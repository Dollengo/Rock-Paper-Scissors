# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game
This **Python** script allows you to play the classic game of Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer.

# How it works
- The script first randomly selects a play for the computer: 1 for **Rock**, 2 for **Paper**, or 3 for **Scissors**.
- It then **prompts** you to enter your play: ‘rock’ for Rock, ‘paper’ for Paper, or ‘scissors’ for Scissors.
- The script compares your **play** with the computer’s play according to the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors: Rock crushes 
  Scissors, Scissors cuts Paper, and Paper covers Rock.
- Finally, the **script** announces the plays and the outcome of the game: ‘Win’ if you win, ‘Game over’ if you lose, or    ‘Drew’ if it’s a draw.

This script is a fun way to pass the time and can also be used as a **decision-making tool**.
